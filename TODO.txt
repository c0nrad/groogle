Todo List


- Information to be shown when node is clicked on/hover

1. - Nodes should be as big as their frequency
   1.) Have 5ish different sizes?
   2.) Each node will be given a size depending on their word freqeucny
   3.) Based on a percantage of the total


- Pop up menu at start to ask for initial search
- Tabbed searches, also maybe a way of copying them over
- Zoomin/out and pan handling done exclusivly with mouse
2. - Delete nodes with children
   - 

3. - Add support for facebook and twitter searches only (WIKI)
   - This should be a new project?
     - Just a wiki version would be neat, and possibly even useful

- Multiple links per node pair?
  - I don't think this happens, but it should be looked into. Perhaps have a sceneDump() function to check over it

- Double click on node expands all
  - Instead maybe just expand all selectedNodes that aren't already selected

- Add seeds
