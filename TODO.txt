Todo List

- Make double clicking on nodes more exciting (have it expand dynamically)
- Highlight path back to parent
- Information to be shown when node is clicked on/hover
- Nodes should be as big as their frequency
- Pop up menu at start to ask for initial search
- Tabbed searches, also maybe a way of copying them over
- Zoomin/out and pan handling done exclusivly with mouse
- Delete nodes with children
- Fix multithreading issue
- Add support for facebook and twitter searches only
