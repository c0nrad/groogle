Todo List (Ordered by priority)

---All---:
- Make sure all functions are properly using the "[+], [*]" interface for debugging.

  - [*] Is for the start of a function
  - [+] Is an information update saying that all is going according to plan
  - [-] Is when a problem occurs and is hopefully handled

- Finish commenting code, make sure to finalize style guidelines
